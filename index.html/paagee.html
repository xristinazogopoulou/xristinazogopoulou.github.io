   <div class="menu"> <h1> Art and Community </h1> </div>
    <p> Hong Kong people have been creating through art. </p>
    <p> There are many initiatives that encourage community engagement. </p>
    <p>"That really reminds me of a line that I wrote for my film
        The Soong Sisters, which was cut out, actually, by the Chinese censorship.
      <p>  - No, no, we put it back. </p>
      <p>  - Yeah, for the Japanese version. We secretly put it back for Japan. </p>
        
        <p> The last shot of the movie in which you actually see a Bible
        left behind by Charlie Soong for his three daughters and he said, there's a line in this Bible
        that I want you to remember the rest of your life.
        And the line says, "Revolution is form of love and love is a form of revolution."
        And I think, I think because this is
        what I truly believe in, and that is,
        when you start a revolution, you are actually
        starting a love affair with something you believe in.
        Or, on the other hand, when you love somebody, when you fall in love with somebody you're actually starting a revolution for your life."
